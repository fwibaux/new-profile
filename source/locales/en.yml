  about:  "I started working in 2000 as sales assistant for one of the european remarketing distributor for professionnal IT equipment (<%= link_to 'IB Remarketing','http://www.ibremarketing.com', target: '_blank' %>). After a few months, I developped the first sales and customers for Sun Microsystems equipment and became officially Account manager. Then, my boss asked me to build a team of sales and technicians to push further the development of this newly created business unit. Quickly we were 10 guys focusing on Sun Microsystems sales and tech challenges."
